Modify the createPages function so that if a Product has 1 Variant it uses productTemplate1, if it has  2-5 Variants it uses productTemplate2 (where the imagePath1 is for the first Variant, and the images for the second - fifth Variants are located on the right-side, in a 2x2 grid, underneath the description where the width of each plus a margin is half the width of the info section), if it has 6 or more Variants it uses productTemplate1 for the first Variant and one (or more) productTemplate3 instances for the remaining Variants (where Variant template instances in productTemplate3 are arranged in a 4x3 grid). To clarify when there are 6 Variants on a Product, the first Variant is shown in productTemplate1 and the next 5 Variants are shown in productTemplate3, where Variants 2-4 are in the first row of the grid, and Variant 6 is in the second row of the grid. To clarify when there are 14 Variants on a Product, the first Variant is shown in productTemplate1, the next 12 Variants are shown in the first instance of productTemplate3, and the 14th Variant is shown in the second instance of productTemplate3. To clarify when there are 50 Variants on a Product, the first Variant is shown in productTemplate1, and then the remaining 49 Variants are shown in 5 instances of productTemplate3 (12 Variants, 12 Variants, 12 Variants, 12 Variants, 1 Variant).
